# Datastructure
- Datastructures as presheaf category (1)
- Pattern matching without automorphism (2, link with 1 + sheaf pattern match article ?)
    + An idea is to represent pattern matching as a sequence of matching of atomic elements (pattern decomposition)

# Engine
- Open category, function in place of list of objects (3)
- More efficient matching for Labelisation (4, link with 2)
    + Matching a decorated triangle matches every symmetries of the triangle regardless of broken symmetries by the labels
- Better interplay between Open and Labelisation (5, link with 3)
    + For example only one function that compute the rhs. ATM we need two functions: one for the labels of the rhs and one for open rhs 
- Structural rule families (5)
    + For example match every cycles
- Remove use of identity object in engine (6)
- Star with no recursion + all matches are in the fifo (7)
- Compute minimal suture via maximal instances (8)

# Tests
- Open + Label example with structure of the rhs depends of the labels (9)
- Conplicated example (ex: montains + rivers), rule "composition" ? (10)
